### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

    My name is Kaustubh and I am an economist based in India.
    I have a degree in economics from a top university,
    and have worked on a variety of projects related to economic analysis and policy.
    Some of my notable achievements include publishing several papers in leading academic journals
    and receiving an award for my research on the economic impact of trade policies.

    In my free time, I enjoy reading about economics and finance,
    as well as playing sports and exploring the outdoors. 
    I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, 
    and am excited to be a part of the vibrant developer community on GitHub.
### I am learning Python.
